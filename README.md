# P2PDEX by TurbineSwap

TurbineSwap P2PDEX is a smart contract facilitating peer-to-peer cryptocurrency-fiat trading (on/off ramp) without third-party involvement. It has a built-in dispute resolution mechanism and minimizing fraud risk.

There are several benefits of having a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange, such as TurbineSwap P2PDEX, that operates on smart contracts.

Firstly, decentralization means that the exchange is not owned or controlled by any central authority, eliminating the need for trust in third-party intermediaries such as banks or other centralized escrow services. This provides users with greater autonomy and control over their assets, as they can transact directly with each other without relying on a middleman to hold or transfer funds.

Secondly, the use of smart contracts allows for the automation of the trading process, making it faster and more efficient. The rules and conditions of the trade are encoded in the smart contract, ensuring that they are executed automatically and without the need for manual intervention. This not only reduces the risk of errors and delays, but also eliminates the need for intermediaries, further reducing transaction costs.

Another benefit of having a decentralized exchange on smart contracts like TurbineSwap P2PDEX is the inbuilt dispute resolution mechanism. When an order runs through a dispute, an independent arbitrator verifies the proofs of both parties and resolves it in a peaceful manner. The arbitrator earns 80% of the trading fee in such case and Turbine Swap only keeps the remaining 20%. This not only makes dispute resolution more fair and impartial, but also incentivizes the arbitrator to provide a high-quality service to the users. Overall, the dispute resolution mechanism in TurbineSwap P2PDEX provides users with a more reliable and efficient means of resolving any conflicts that may arise during the trading process.

Overall, a decentralized peer-to-peer exchange on smart contracts like TurbineSwap P2PDEX provides users with greater control, efficiency, and security over their cryptocurrency transactions.
